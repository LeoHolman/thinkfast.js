Welcome to ThinkFast! In this game you act as the librarian answering student reference questions.
Student will come up to the desk and ask you questions, select the resource type that best meets the student's need with the buttons on screen.
If you give a resource type that meets the student's need, they will thank you, otherwise, they will stick around until you give them a good resource.
Read more about each resource type in the feedback box below the buttons.
There are 10 questions in total, you can track which question you're on with the number at the bottom right of the question. 
Have fun!
